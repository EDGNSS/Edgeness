# Edgeness

EDGENESS revisits the Internet Architecture by leveraging Software Defined Networks (SDN) with Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) technologies to allow efficient and on-demand placement of Virtual Network Functions (VNF) on a serverless platform for energy-aware function provisioning in edge environments. It is funded by the European Next Generation Internet Pointer Call 2.

## Software Architecture

Network management strategies are undergoing a transition from using the proprietary technology of a vendor toward the open-source software modules with service automation. The first glimmer of this transformation is Software Defined Networking (SDN) that accelerate the design and implementation of the next generation computer
networks.

Realizing the promise of SDN requires intent-based management and control with guarantees on safety, scale, and performance. A modular and micro-service based SDN architecture can divide the controller functionalities and applications into a set of cooperative micro-services.

## Mission

Energy consumption in the Internet architecture is one of the highest operating costs. Energy is becoming even more important due to climate change and sustainability considerations. The advent of 5G mobile-network technology is bringing a significant increase in data traffic and the infrastructure to support it, which consequently will consume more energy. There is proliferation of applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT) benefiting from edge computing solutions, e.g. scalability. However, applicationâ€™s performance lies with not only efficient node-level execution but energy consumption as well as these applications may operate in a low energy computing environment. The energy increase coming from applications and infrastructure calls for action. Network load optimisation and efficient resource management are essential to ensure a reduction in total energy consumption.
